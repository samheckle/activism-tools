# How to Add to This List

This is an open source repository! There are pretty loose guidelines since it is a list of links, but you will need to have a local "fork" of this repository to propose any changes. This is like making a copy of a folder, changing your personal copy, and then adding those changes back to the original. It also maintains who contributed what resources, that way we can always have a reference and citation of who added what information. Here is an [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request), but we have the steps below. 

!! If you don't feel comfortable adding your name to this repository, you can message one of the maintainers! Sam can be contacted via email `samheckle(at)yahoo.com` or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/samanthiik/). If you would like to be added as a contributor, please don't hesitate to ask!
